# MagicalSpreadsheets

Spreadsheets for fun !!! 

The goal of this project was to show what imagination, passion and creativity can do even with serious tools such as a Spreadsheet.

## Getting Started

Unfortunately, not all Spreadsheet Editors are coded equal. Each spreadsheet editor has their own characteristics and limitations, because they are created by different groups of people. When opening a file in another editor basic formulas normally work fine but more complex data will probably produce an error. Here are the list of functionality for each application


| Application | Version | Notes |
|:---:|:---:|:---|
| LibreOffice |6.1| - The most complete from this list  - Allows complex Conditional Formatting  - Support newest functions such as MINFIS  - Processes Regular Expressions|
| Apache OpenOffice|4.1| - Very pretty but non standard input entry  - Allows complex Conditional Formatting  - Missing support newest functions  - Lacks Regular Expressions support|
|Excel|2010| - Lots of users, reason why I migrated it  - Allows some Conditional Formatting with simple styles  - Bug found in Conditional Formatting background colour  - Support newest functions  - Lacks Regular Expressions support |
| Excel|2003| - Lots of users, reason why I migrated it  - Allows some Conditional Formatting with simple styles  - Support newest functions  - Lacks Regular Expressions support|
| Google Sheets| May 2020  | - Handy to be online but has limitations  - Allows some Conditional Formatting with basic styles  - Conditional formatting without worksheets references  - Support lots of new functions including Google's  - Regular Expressions has their own format  - Some functions have different defaults|
